# NYU Summer Scholar'2021 - Machine Learning
Under Prof. Fraida Fund

### What is [NYU Summer Scholar](https://engineering.nyu.edu/admissions/graduate/admitted-students/jumpstart-your-nyu-experience) ?
* NYU admitted students have the opportunity to apply to become a Summer Scholar and take a summer class within their MS program remotely — completely free of charge. The 3-credit course includes a final exam or project upon arrival in-person for the fall semester, at which time students will receive course credit as part of their Fall 2021 semester course load.
* Taking the course this summer doesn’t just save up to $6,000 on students' education; it frees up valuable time in the fall to get to know the campus, the city, and fellow classmates and to pursue other interests and career opportunities sooner.

### TSS - Machine Learning Coursework 
#### Objective
Intro to Machine Learning is a busy, fast-paced course. A wide range of fundamental techniques in machine learning, and each one from multiple perspectives were covered:

* Developed an intuition for how the technique works
* Got formalized with mathematical descriptions of each technique
* Understood practical issues to be aware of when using the technique
* Applied the technique to a "real", genuinely challenging problem

#### Algos covered
